### Class and Objects
-   A class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions. It's a blue-print of a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviours.
-   An object is an instance of a class

### Encapsulation
-   Defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

### Abstraction
-   Refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
